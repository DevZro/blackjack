# blackjack
This is my blackjack game
it is still aesthetically incomplete but has all the working functions
There is no real cap on how many players can play but 4 or less is probably ideal
The game starts off with each player having 10000 units of cash and each bet can be made with a minimum of 25 
h stands for hit
d stands for double-down
s1 stands for stand
s2 stands for split
s3 stands for surrender
Enjoy
